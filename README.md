# sodium-correction-rate

Our Streamlit application, called "Sodium Correction Rate Calculator", provides healthcare professionals with a tool to calculate sodium correction rate in patients with hyponatremia or hypernatremia. This application is easy to use, needing only the user to input the patient's current and desired sodium levels, weight, and time period for correction.
